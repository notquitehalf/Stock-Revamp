		// ********** Part: AerobeeMk1

		#AerobeeMk1_Part_description = A compact and lightweight 0.625 meter engine, the M82 produces plenty of thrust for smaller rockets in atmosphere, butnot enough to out-run 1.25m class engines, especially at higher altitudes. The M82 was originally developed for several of C7 Industries C-planes' experimental supersonic trials, but was later dropped due to availability concerns after a Rockomax Conglomerate import ban in the early 2240's. Most of the remaining prototypes have been mothballed and need extensive modification to avoid our current mix of LFO from eating away at several critical components.
